# Retinafier

Demo: http://beverlycheak.com/mindarc/retinafier.html

Previously built to make retina-optimised email and web development a lot easier and faster.

## How to Use

Paste the @x2 (double sized) HTML code generated from Photoshop slices into the editor and click "Retinafy".

Width and height attributes of `<img>` and `<table>` elements etc. will be halved and retina-screen ready!
